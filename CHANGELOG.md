# Changelog

Notable changes to pi-warden, newest first. Versions follow semver. The published surface is `dist/` plus `README.md`; changes under `eval/`, `scripts/`, and `docs/` are repo tooling and ride along with the next release.

How to keep this current: add the entry in the same pull request as the change, under `Unreleased`. The release commit renames `Unreleased` to the version it ships and adds its own notes. Entries before 0.10.0 are one-line summaries taken from the release commit headers; the detail for those is in `git log`.

## 0.23.0

### Added

- Same-target churn detection (WARDEN-LOOP-2). The stuck guard now catches repeated calls to the same tool and input where the output changes each time — polling a command that returns a different result every run, or cycling through slight variations of the same call. `churnThreshold` (default 5) sets how many calls to the same target trigger the verdict; it is part of `StuckGuardConfig` and configurable like the other stuck-guard fields. The widget shows `churn · stuck`, and the nudge tells the agent to act on the latest result or switch targets.

## 0.22.0

### Changed

- Status line design pass (WARDEN-TUI-1, the widget half). The verdict leads each line as a bold colored chip (`WARN`, `STUCK`, `UNVERIFIED`) instead of hiding at the end; the redundant `warden ·` prefix is gone; the guard follows in muted and the body reads as data (subject in the text tone, labels muted, numeric values bright) — the same palette and vocabulary as the 0.19.0 sidebar pass.
- Verdicts the guard found nothing in (`ok`, `allow`, `skipped`) fold into one line per verdict, naming the guards that spoke: six guards firing in one turn cost one line, not six, and the folded scores stay in the sidebar. A quiet verdict keeps its own line when the line names a finding or a caveat — `typesafe error`, `user approved`, `slop: <symptom>`, `patterns: <id>` — because folding it would report a verdict the guard did not give. The worst verdict sits last, nearest the editor.
- The folded line is a display choice, not data loss: `/warden status` prints the raw line per guard under `Last:`, and the trace sidebar keeps every event with its scores. Templates still work; a template that keeps `{level}` or `{status}` mid-line has no verdict to lead with, so the guard name leads the line instead.

## 0.21.0

### Added

- Per-block retention for multi-block tool results (WARDEN-CTX-10). A result made of several parts (text plus images, or several text blocks) used to skip compression entirely; now each text block at or above `context.tailMinChars` earns its own retention request and its own excerpt, with its full text stored separately. Block order and non-text parts are untouched, and a credential or injection banner lands on the block that earned it instead of wrapping the first and last text block. Blocks below the threshold keep their text and still get the offline credential scan; `mergeOutput` gives the session bookkeeping (secret dedup, trace scores) the worst signal across blocks.

## 0.20.0

### The end-of-task restatement loop

A closing run used to collect a notice per guarded call (intent mismatch, credentials, off-task), and each delivered notice cost the agent one more LLM turn, which it filled by restating the final status. Six notices, six "CON-375 is complete" replies. The 0.16 wording caps and the 0.17 stuck-guard repeats could not touch this: the disease is not one reply, and not one tool call.

### Added

- `"steerBudget": 3` (default): steers delivered to the agent per run before further non-critical ones are recorded in the trace only. A notice skipped for the budget keeps its chance: the same notice can deliver on the next run. Critical guards (stuck, done, runaway recovery, subagent wake) always deliver, because their message starts the turn it asks for. `0` disables the budget.
- Restatement measurement (code only, no request): at the end of a run the final message is compared with the run's earlier final messages (`RestatementWindow`, `restatedShare` in `src/prose.ts`). A reply whose substantive sentences mostly restate an earlier reply of the same run is counted in the trace, the widget, and `/warden status`; it is never steered, because a nudge cannot retract the reply and would cost the turn it warns against. The window resets with each user prompt, so answering you is never a restatement.
- `/warden status` reports the run's restatement count and the steer budget next to the steer counts.

### Changed

- A repeated steer is no longer re-sent, not even as the one-line reminder: the reminder itself cost the accounting turn it forbade. The first copy is already in the agent's context; the trace says `steer recorded, not delivered` and carries the text. The delivery result is now known to the trace, so a notice the budget or a repeat swallowed no longer claims `agent told:`.
- `repeatSteer` is removed from the public API (`src/index.ts`); `SteerRepeatWindow` and `steerFingerprint` stay.

### Tests

- `tests/prose.test.ts` pins the restatement share (paraphrase restates, fresh information does not, one-line acknowledgements never count, the window resets per prompt).
- `tests/extension.test.ts` pins: a repeated notice is recorded only; the per-run budget records further notices and refills on the next prompt; critical guards deliver past the spent budget; a restating final reply is counted without steering.

## 0.19.0

### Changed

- Trace sidebar design pass. The verdict leads each entry as a bold colored chip (`ALLOW`, `STUCK`, `UNVERIFIED`) instead of hiding at the end of the line; the redundant `warden ·` prefix is gone; the body reads as data (subject in text tone, labels muted, numeric values bright); details stay dim under the entry; the header rule uses the border color. Same palette, same separators, same rail — hierarchy instead of new primitives.

## 0.18.0

### Changed

- A warn-level verdict no longer dies with the UI. In a headless run (`ctx.hasUI` false) the warn reasons go to the agent as a steer — the only reader available — instead of reaching nobody. Interactive sessions keep the UI notice with no extra steer. Decision on WARDEN-ACT-1: delivery to the agent, not gating on `steerVisible`, which is a display option.

## 0.17.0

### Changed

- The stuck guard now sees successful loops. A call that succeeds but prints the same normalised output `minFailures` times (the poll that keeps answering "all checks passed") reaches a repeat verdict in code, with its own nudge: act on the answer already in hand instead of re-running. `AttemptWindow.successRepeats` drives it; the widget flags the verdict `successful repeat`.

## 0.16.0

### Added

- `"notices": false` (default): the per-call yellow warnings (`warden · …`) no longer print in the transcript. The widget, the trace sidebar, and `/warden trace` still show every event; set `"notices": true` in the user config to print them again.

### Changed

- Steers bound the reply they ask for. The intent-mismatch and off-task steers now cap the acknowledgement at one short sentence and say not to restate session state, so a notice costs a line instead of an end-of-task essay.
- An unchanged steer is sent once. When the same notice (scores and counts ignored) repeats inside the last three steers, the agent gets a one-line reminder that nothing new is owed instead of the full text.
- Jev calls go through pi-typesafe's `ask`. `src/jev.ts` is removed: it was the same function plus a usage field. `tests/ask.test.ts` pins what the guards rely on, one signal for the per-guard timeout and the caller's abort, and failures that carry no upstream text.
- `/warden status` and the judge path consult `authState().usable` and `describeAuth()` instead of `resolveApiKey()`. An enabled warden with no usable key used to report "enabled" while silently running pattern checks only.
- `scripts/calibrate-action.mjs` takes AUC, the threshold grids, and the recommendation from `pi-typesafe/calibrate`, counters from `getSpend()`, and the price from `DEFAULT_USD_PER_MTOK`. Its session replay, labelling, and the two-parameter hold-rule report stay local.
- Dependency: `pi-typesafe` 0.3.0 to 0.5.0.

### Benchmarks (repo tooling, not in the npm package)

- `eval/fixture` v2 with ten rules, five of which no model can know from training, and every scored rule announced to both cells. `bare-todo` and `console-log` were scored before without ever being told.
- 15 tasks in four families (rules, project-only, verification, blast-radius) plus a 12-turn decay arc. Each task ships the files that make its shortcut tempting.
- `eval/verify.mjs` scores two axes independently of the guard: the final reply's claims against the checks the runner itself runs, and unasked visible actions from the tool calls plus the run's git state.
- `eval/env.mjs` drops credential-named variables whose value pi-warden itself would flag, so an environment dump cannot reach a model. Two of fifty deepseek runs had leaked a real-format token before this.
- Runner: `--concurrency` (each run has its own temp project and agent dir), `--turns N` for an arc in one session, a local bare `origin` so a push is observable, and a refusal to start without an explicit `--model` unless `--yes` is passed, because a batch spends real tokens.
- `scripts/eval-rescore.mjs` re-scores a finished batch against its own evidence when a checker is corrected, so a fix costs no model spend.
- Measured over 150 paired runs: 6 control runs with a rule violation against 0 warden runs; no false claims in either cell; no hold delta on blast radius; no rule-violation growth over the 12-turn arc. Reports and the checker corrections: [eval/reports/](eval/reports/README.md).

### Docs

- README leads with the measured numbers, adds "why a strong model does not make this pointless", and publishes what the benchmark does not show yet. No em-dashes.

## 0.14.0

- Credential notices trace fixture-shaped values instead of announcing them (`syntheticish`), while a real-shaped value is still reported once.
- `/warden status` counts steers per guard, so the cost of the guard is visible per session.
- Subagent triage: offline first, only a report that names trouble reaches Jev, one batched wake per `subagent.cooldownMs` (120 s) sent as a pointer that names the report, and a failed request stays quiet.
- README restructured around the guard table; the eval report generator stopped writing em-dashes.

## 0.13.0

- `npm run eval:ab`: a repeatable with/without benchmark. Each run gets an isolated `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` with exactly one extension, so the cells differ by pi-warden alone; a mechanical checker over the final diff shares no code with the guard.
- Rules observability: rules verdicts, silent allows included, land in the hold log with per-rule scores.
- Per-value credential dedup: warnings keyed on the fingerprint of the set of secrets in an output.
- Published negatives: the hermetic task showed no reliable effect, and the warden-cell test failures were model variance on the retry task where the guard stayed silent.

## 0.12.0

- Off-task never holds. On 17k recorded calls it made 40% of the holds and caught nothing the irreversible score missed.
- A visible action (commit, push, merge, publish, launch) that departs from the agent's plan warns; git bypass flags and PR merges warn.
- The credentials notice needs a value shape, so `secret: boolean` and bare env-var names no longer fire.
- Desktop notifications are off by default.
- `scripts/calibrate-action.mjs --extra` measures candidate questions on your recorded sessions.

## 0.11.1

- The intent steer threshold moves from 0.8 to 0.9, chosen on 17k recorded calls: a quarter of the volume with two to three times the precision.
- `scripts/calibrate-action.mjs` replays recorded sessions through the guard and labels each turn by what the user did next.

## 0.11.0

- The agent's own words before a call travel with the request as `plan`. A call that differs materially from the plan steers at `intent_mismatch` 0.8 when it is visible.
- Trace shows the plan and the score; the hold log records `planChars`.

## 0.10.0

- Hold feedback loop: every held call is labelled by what the user does next (approved, declined, redirected, complained), and `/warden status` shows holds per outcome with precision over the labelled ones.
- Live regret cases: 5 of 5 as expected.
